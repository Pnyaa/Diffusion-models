# Diffusion-models

This repositoy contains the code and report for a "Projet Fil Rouge" (Red Thread Project?) carried out in partnership with Safran during our formation. <br>
The aim of the project was to study the use of diffusion models to generate images of materials. As this was our first deep learning project, we began by studying the different types of generative models, before looking in more detail at the first diffusion model (DDPM) and Stable Diffusion.
